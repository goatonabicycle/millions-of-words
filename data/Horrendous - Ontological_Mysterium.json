  "description": "With 'Ontological Mysterium', HORRENDOUS have built a towering death-metal thrill ride.\n\nThe sheer size and scope of their new album is massive. Riffs twist and turn through labyrinthine arrangements, busting out into soaring melodic leads. 'Ontological Mysterium' captures the true spirit of the halcyon days of extreme metal.",
