  "description": "This album was written in the wake of Israel's escalation of genocide against the Palestinian people, but is also rooted in the deep systemic issues that American and Western culture imposes on both its citizens and the people of the world through force, punishment, violence, and coercion. Western ideology is not sustainable; the American empire is not sustainable.\n\n\n\nAll profits will be donated to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society \n\nwww.palestinercs.org/en\n\n\n\n No AI was used or ever will be used in any capacity on this or any proceeding albums",
