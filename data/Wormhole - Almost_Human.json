  "description": "WORMHOLE erupt from the underground with 'Almost Human', their third album and first for Season of Mist.\n\nThe Baltimore band have punched a hole through the death metal continuum with their outrageous onslaught of tech slam. Crushing riffs churn and shift and grind like one of those desert-dwelling behemoths from ‘Dune’, and lay the bedrock for a brutal vocal assault.\n\n'Almost Human' shows WORMHOLE’s rapid, writhing ascent. There’s no ceiling they can’t slam through.",
