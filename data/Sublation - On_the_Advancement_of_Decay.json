  "description": "Press: \n\n\n\n\"I applaud Sublation for trying something innovative, and in a world where the quality of the concept all too often exceeds the actual final product, I applaud them for absolutely nailing the execution. Lest there be any doubt, On The Advancement Of Decay comes very highly recommended.\" - Sleeping Village Reviews  \n\n\n\nwww.sleepingvillagereviews.com/reviews--premieres/sublation-on-the-advancement-of-decay-review\n\n\n\n \"The cohesiveness of this narrative is downright remarkable. If you take two songs at random it still feels like they belong together, which is about as high of a compliment as I can give to a project like this.\" - Noobheavy  \n\n\n\nnoobheavy.com/ep-review-sublation-on-the-advancement-of-decay/\n\n\n\n \"Whether this marks a new direction or is simply a side step remains to be seen but either way it demonstrates they can turn their hands to anything they desire and make it work, this Blackened Death Metal offering being of the highest order [8/10]\" -  metalnoise.net\n\n\n\n  metalnoise.net/2023/12/review-on-the-advancement-of-decay-by-sublation\n\n\n\n \"it’s hard to believe this is the same band. Are the two modes too different to appear on the same short record?\" - Slow Dragon Music  \n\n\n\nwww.slowdragonmusic.com/articles/feeding-frenzy/feeding-frenzy-helfro-plaguemace-more-01-12-23/?fbclid=PAAaZQoncEXjPl5dxXl3oDhw6JlR_a7gZrGdnGHVOZLZ1r5w_-bUqH7cEscfA\n\n\n\n \"their slower passages have a hypnotic power and drama that leans toward the sludgy doom of Crowbar before leaping right at your face\" - Burning Ambulance \n\n\n\nburningambulance.substack.com/p/5-albums-i-like",

Così, il riposo notturno non soltanto attenua la potenza del nostro pensiero, ma ne smorza persino i segreti più intimi.\n\nI wrap myself in bliss\nI’m getting sick from it\nOverindulgence \nEuphoric necrosis \n\nNo longer do I wonder \nMy sense of awe eclipsed \nI cannot take another \nwretched day of this \n\nI grasp at light, I suffocate it\nI’ve become numb, my life, bromidic \nThis reclamation, unsubstantiated\nThere is no pleasure that I have not corrupted \n\nI see the stars, no longer do I weep\nThis world is conquered, known, complete\nWe were explorers, we charted seas \nWe cultivated indifference, we became beasts\n\nI dream no more\nMy grief consumes\nDelight in death, my end, my truth"
