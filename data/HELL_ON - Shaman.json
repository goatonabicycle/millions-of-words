  "description": "This album had to be released two years ago, but a full-scale invasion of Ukraine by russia has put our entire life on hold. Nowadays, due to our Armed Forces, we try to go on living and creating. We are sure that the spirit of this struggle was reflected in this work. It is hidden somewhere among the strings of the guitars, in the echoes of shamanic tribal vocals and flashes of ritual fires.",
