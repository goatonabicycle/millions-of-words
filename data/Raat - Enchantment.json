  "description": "\"Enchantment\" melds ethereal atmospheric melodies with unrelenting, ferocious intensity crafting a profound experience that is both haunting and transcendent.\n\n\n\nTwo years after the release of their excellent sophomore full-length, \"Celestial Woods\", RAAT return with their most ambitious and captivating body of work yet in the form of the much anticipated third long-player titled \"Enchantment\".\n\n\n\nComprised of 7 tracks, \"Enchantment\" presents ferocious passages of piercing black metal fury fused with softer moments of ethereal, otherworldly beauty as it peregrinates ever so effortlessly yet highly effectively throughout its duration. The omnipresence of ravening riffs, complex song structures, a unique dreamlike atmosphere, searing, tortured vocals and the consistent element of surprise, combine to channel an album that is sure to be an instant underground classic.\n\n\n\nDark, gripping, dynamic, heavy, and breathtakingly beautiful at the same time, \"Enchantment\" will take you on an exquisite journey that you’d want to partake of repeatedly.",

      "lyrics": "As the night draws close\nAnd curious stars light the dark\nRevealing affliction and a hidden path\nAmidst deep entrails \nWoven from the frailty of our blood\nThus awoke the cult of the fiery horn\nA prayer for lawless eyes\nFumes of bereft light atoned\nAscend towards the moon, as it whispers\nTravel into the darker realms of crimson haze\nAnd in these moments of ingress,\nOf undressing the unknown, \nI promise a light second to none\nIn an oath never cleft in twain\nAs the measure of an unfurled weight was carved\nAnd the final straw dislodged\nOnly once but everlastingly\nWere these roots entwined\nWhen the immortal night echoed\nThe ebb and flow of the chanting waves\nOf a river in spate\nSoaring in a majestic cavalcade\nAs a silver thread riveted these scars to my veins"
