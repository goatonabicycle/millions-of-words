      "lyrics": "Eyes watching over me\nExpectations smothering me\nInhaling black smoke\nDeep breathing servitude\n\nThe mind and the body melt\nScorched by the sun\nThey coagulate \nAnd when it’s over\nUnrecognised, unsalvageable\n\nConcrete trapping heat\nPerfect grey jagged edges cave in on me\nThings being pulverised in the distance\nCrushed into a fine dust\nDead carcass in the gutter\nLive carcass on the street\nNo thought of the future\nI drift off \n\nNothing looking back\nA gaze that sees no reflections\nA trance-like state\nThe smell of burnt particles left behind\nSounds of the city fade away\n\nHaze clears\nAll concrete things are dissolving\nAround me\nOne thing flows into another smoothly\n\nNo tangible thoughts exist here"
