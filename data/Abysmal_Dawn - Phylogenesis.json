  "description": "After 6 years of silence, American death metal collective Abysmal Dawn have returned with ‘Phylogenesis,’ their most technical and refined offering to date. The highly-anticipated album displays a clear evolution from the band as they put forth a complex cacophony of searing riffs, blood-curdling vocals, and pummeling drums.",
