  "description": "-- VISIONS OF INFINIHILITY --\n\n\n\nBased upon the same universe explored in the bands previous album,\n\nVISIONS OF INFINIHILITY breathes new vigour into the bands style of Thrashing Death Metal and the stories once told.\n\nStaying true to their ideals the band continues to slurp the veins of different genres and drool the writhing mixture into their mold of metal\n\n- bulging chugs and spider riffs\n\n- 7-string-phat-bass-brutalism\n\n- blast beats and confused unga bunga\n\n- throat-tearing growls and shrieks\n\n\n\nActing as both a prequel and a contemporary side-story to their previous album, VISIONS OF INFINIHILITY offers further insight into the world of Carnosus.\n\n\n\n”𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘴 𝘦𝘹𝘤𝘦𝘭𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘴𝘵𝘶𝘧𝘧 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘢𝘯𝘺𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘩𝘶𝘯𝘨𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘯𝘦𝘸 𝘵𝘦𝘤𝘩”\n\n- ToiletOvHell\n\n\n\n\"...𝘳𝘢𝘸, 𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘷𝘺 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘵𝘩𝘺 𝘢𝘴 𝘧*𝘤𝘬\"\n\n- Technical music review\n\n\n\n\"𝘤𝘢𝘱𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨, 𝘦𝘯𝘨𝘢𝘨𝘪𝘯𝘨, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘶𝘯𝘺𝘪𝘦𝘭𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨\"\n\n- Head-banger Reviews\n\n\n\n\"𝘝𝘪𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘐𝘯𝘧𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘩𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘺 𝘩𝘢𝘴 𝘢 𝘩𝘪𝘨𝘩 𝘲𝘶𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘺 𝘴𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘰 𝘪𝘵 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘢𝘴𝘴 𝘢𝘥𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘨 𝘨𝘳𝘰𝘰𝘷𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘳𝘪𝘧𝘧𝘴, 𝘸𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘩 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘥𝘦𝘧𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘭𝘺 𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘷𝘪𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥\"\n\n- @void_fracture\n\n\n\n\"𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘪𝘳 𝘧𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘳𝘪𝘧𝘧𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦\" | 9/10\n\n- Distorted Sound\n\n\n\n\"𝘈𝘸𝘦𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘮𝘦𝘭𝘰𝘥𝘪𝘤 𝘵𝘸𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘯𝘴\"\n\n- Drako's Death Metal News \u0026 Reviews",
