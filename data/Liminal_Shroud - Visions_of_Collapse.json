      "lyrics": "Strewn amongst the stars\nCataclysmic oblivion\nEndless planes of existence\nAbove as below\n\nConcealed by the whim\nOf rampant, ceaseless chaos\nBlack canopy above\nLost travellers below\n\nInfinite creation\nEscapes the finite mind\nGlimpse eternity\nDeny humankind\n\nAs insects crawl\nUpon the barren earth\nSo too do I\n\nOn all fours scrambling\nThrough the night as vermin\nA stain on sacred ground\n\nTo know the unknown - arrogant and ignorant\nTo gaze on the heavens - blind and stumbling\nTo conquer the beast - weak and trembling\nTo search for peace - discontent and seething\n\nTraverse the banks of the spirit realm\nWonder in awe at their grandeur\nEnraptured by the strength of totality\nThe abyss swallows us whole\n\nUnencumbered by the weight\nOf banality and guise\nSubmitting to the primal skies\nCasting corporeal mass\nInto frothing, endless expanse\nRelentlessly carried forth\n\nEyes open wide\nLight streaming past\nStreaks of colour and life\n\nPhosphorescence darting\nThrough this murky night\nAs streaks of luminescence shines\nTo behold splendor\nAnd deny the mundane\nReleased to cold, eternal might\n\nFlashes coalesce\nAcross my vision\nStars above, light below"

      "lyrics": "What remains but works\nOf earth pushed as pieces\nIn a gambit unknown\n\nAs galaxies gaze down and weep\nTorrents of dying nebulae\nOn the worthlessness of it all\nA hail of destruction\nAt which we stare in awe\nStruck in disbelief, paralyzed in ignorance\nCathartic as conflagration descends\nTo proselytize the ultimate truth\n\nThe truth of this earth\nThe truth of the stars\nOf the marrow, the cartilage, the flesh\nThe iron, the bough, the loam\nThe husk, the grist, the waste\nThe microcosm, the outer spheres\n\nThe truth of the earth\nThe truth of the stars\n\nThat the blight is written\nInto our cells\nMapped to pale tendrils\nEmbryonic, frail, inchoate\nYet ever-blooming, every-devouring\nRavenous to swallow the last star"

      "lyrics": "Tear this broken, wretched form\nFrom the nether of compulsion\nSee the husk you left, abandoned\nWhen the ether was long spent \nNone of nature's grace remains\nCollapsing into the earth\nNo warmth in this cold embrace\nChills the bone and shattered spirit\n\nTake my breath, take my soul\nInhale pain, doubt, and longing\n\nLungs caving in, gasping desperately\nFeel the rush of the wind\nFrom across the churning sea\nRip through this frail, spent body\n\nConsternation\nDesperation\nFutility\nDepravity\n\nThe moment where I fade away\nInto a nihilistic haze\nWretched hands, not my own\nGrasping a broken fucking chalice\n\nInsatiation\nDegradation\nImpulsivity\nAnimosity\n\nAlone, adrift in timeless wanderings\nCarried through the stream\nCeaseless chaos permeates my mind\nA mind that’s not my own\nAgainst the current of a calling voice\nA voice that's not my own\n\nStanding by while on the shores of time\nForever wondering \nWhat life could be if not for this dream\nA frail, yearning call\n\nA frozen, aching heart\nWeak and trembling flesh\nLofty vain ambition\nSteals our will and vision\n\nOur will and vision\n\nA hardened, steel mind\nStrong and proven flesh\nAction and resolve\nProve our will and vision\n\nOur will and vision"

      "lyrics": "Dark, despondent waters\nSculpt and erode ancient stone\nWaves of rock emerge in their stead\n\nAs is the grim certainty\nOf aching, grinding misery\nOn this husk of ashen skin and weathered bones\n\nDisintegrating, darkened eyes\nWitness as the body dies\nReduced and crumbling shards in the tide\n\nTorn from the foundation\nRaw impermanence exposed \nShattered and broken \nNo trace of what once was real\n\nTime etches away\nAt the core of our souls\nNo respite, no resolution\nOnly fragments drifting \nAimlessly"

      "lyrics": "Where waves scale scarped pillars\nFortifications forged\nIn tempest and night’s high chorus\nOf howling winter wolves\nWithstanding until standing no longer\nHewn into nothingness\nCalled into the abyss\nThe carving scythe - eternal as the tide\n\nHow rains pierce and scar the skin\nAs frail as parchment scraps\nThrown to shearing winds\nTo be woven into nests\nThat yet are scattered among the litter\nOf lives shed as autumn leaves\nThe carving scythe - stormswept branches in the nether\n\nThe river swells with blood and ash\nFlotsam of centuries intermixed\nWith rotted organs, forgotten strife,\nEphemeral words\nForging ever-onward, all-consuming\nGathered legends and weathered vessels\nThe carving scythe - black waters cascade\nListing into lightless chasms\n\nStalking, reaping\nThe sickle soars in steel skies\nFlanked by carrion feeders\nCawing for the remnants\nMorsels left in the wake\nOf merciless death and decay\nLanguage lost; spirit discarded\nJust waiting to be carrion ourselves\n\nThe flood will come in the end\nUndulating waves, submerging the sun\nConsciousness claimed\nBy umbral veil\nBy rapids flowing ever-outward\nBereft, exiled, no future, no past\nCast into suffering’s eclipse\nTo bliss, non-existence\nTo drift for eternity"
