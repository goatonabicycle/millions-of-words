  "description": "Bear witness to 'Ascetic Reflection', the long awaited return of the Australian power-trio ALTARS.\n\nIn eight tracks spanning 40 minutes, the group bends Death Metal to its will in new transcendental forms. An evolution that reflects and expands upon the sound established by the group's critically acclaimed debut 'Paramnesia'.\n\n\n\n'Ascetic Reflection’ is the long-awaited follow up to the bands debut — an evolution that reflects and expands upon the sound established by Paramnesia. Engineered, mixed and mastered entirely by the band themselves in January 2022 — Ascetic Reflection is an arcane and powerfully organic culmination of the renewed trio's efforts.\n\nAdorned by a sweeping gatefold painting by Adam Burke, and a series of internal collages created by Derek Setzer, ‘Ascetic Reflection’ interrogates one’s perception of the self. The opposing halves of the work, each reflecting outward from its centre, form mirrors by which to measure humanity's true face — inverse views of its ouroboric cycles, mortal burdens, and futile lust for power, knowledge and the divine.\n\n\n\nEnigmatic Australian Death Metal entity ALTARS rose sharply to prominence with the release of their 2013 debut ‘Paramnesia’ (Nuclear Winter Records/Blood Harvest). The record quickly drew widespread acclaim for the band's dynamic, forward thinking compositions — hearkening to the genre's forebears whilst carving a niche all their own.\n\nAfter a premature halt, in part due to a debilitating illness affecting co-founding member Cale Schmidt (vocals and bass, see also Monomakh), ALTARS entered a long period of dormancy. Guitarist Lewis Fischer joined the ranks of Melbourne outfit Ignivomous, while drummer Alan Cadman entered the fold of Adelaide’s occult StarGazer. All the while, ‘Paramnesia’ continued to gain status as a cult classic and glimpse of the band's true potential.\n\nAfter eight years of silence, 2021 saw a revived ALTARS announce its resurrection with the promise of a new full-length album, and then the recruitment of Brendan Sloan (Convulsing) to fill the void on bass and vocals — cementing the band as a force to be reckoned with once more.\n\n\n\nFor fans of Ulcerate, Gorguts, Portal, Dead Congregation.",
