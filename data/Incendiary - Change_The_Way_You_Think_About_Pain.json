      "lyrics": "Taken, taken, taken away\nEvery plan I put in motion, every sacrifice I made\nIt stays, it stays the same\nNow the sun is shining but i’m soaked in rain\n\nCreeping up and filling in\nRot the gut, it never ends\nTalk about commitment\nFail to make amends\n\nIt never stops, or goes away\nI rip the weeds from my garden every day \nInfected roots bare poison fruit\n\nIt never stops, or goes away\nI rip the weeds from my garden every day\n\nPromise me there’s a plan for my escape\nPromise me there’s a single shred of faith\n\nCan’t rely on change for changes sake\nCan’t rely on a spirit meant to break\n\nIt never stops or goes away\nI rip the weeds from my garden every day\nInfected roots bare poisoned fruit\n\nIt never stops or goes away\nI rip the weeds from my garden every day\n\nManic thoughts \nPanic states\nReflection showing me everything’s the same\n\nLook into the mirror\nMeet the one you blame\nLook into the mirror\nMeet the one you blame"

      "lyrics": "Foundation starts to shake\nFrom the pounding full of angst \nAnd this door isn’t holding back \nWhat’s in destruction’s wake\n\nI want to know how every bone will break\nHow many breaths are left for me to take\nI try to hold the light but the darkness lies in wait\n\nHow do I own it?\nHow do I control it?\nSuffocate the breathing\nCut the air flowing\n\nGrinding broken glass in between my teeth\nSharpened words dig the shrapnel deep\n\nDrive the nail in place \nIt’s the square route in a circle race\nStubborn as I stand\nI am wound tightly, it’s a classic case\n\nI want to know how every promise breaks\nWho’s going to bet against the chips I’ve placed?\n\nFix my focus with these notes on the page\nI try to hold the light but the darkness lies in wait\n\nGrinding broken glass in between my teeth\nSharpened words dig the shrapnel deep\n\nHow do I own it?\nHow do I control it?\nSuffocate the breathing\nCut the air flowing\n\nWounds won’t heal\nUntil the dirt’s cleaned out"

      "lyrics": "It’s their desperation, the risk they take\nTo flee the terror of a failing state\nEndanger life for just a little taste\nOf freedom, relief, and a sense of place\n\nMilitias stalking the coasts for blood\nIndenturing captives in the desert sun\nTraversing the open sea \nTo feel the sand’s opportunity\n\nAll quiet on the western front\nWhile they cry for help in the eastern mud\nRefusing the calls to deliver aid\nBecause the waiving flag is a different shade\n\nSuffering in silence\nSuffering within\nThey break their spirit\nBreak their fucking will\n\nHeld between no man's land\nPrisoners divide kin from kin\n\nAll quiet on the western front\nWhile they cry for help in the eastern mud\nRefusing the calls to deliver aid\nBecause the waiving flag is a different shade\n\nWhen the well dries up \nThe bread has turned to crumbs\nThey’ll look down at the street\nAnd use the stones to speak \n\nEvery window deserves a brick"
