Pugh)\n\nModern marvels combined with an ancient artifact\nEmerald effervescence sparked the digital sentience transcendence \nImplementation of a new kind, enter the human hive mind\n\nRevolution\nA new era of man is at hand\nFusion of mind and machine (of mind and machine the perfect being)\nEvolution\nThe singularity progress\nThere are no gods but our flesh (no gods but our flesh, none can attest)\n\nPushing the threshold of perception\nAnd the digital blindfold of untold deception\n\nAI enabled this \nstreaming of consciousness\nIndistinguishable from \nDreaming or Waking life\n\nNo gods but our flesh\n\n(Solo M. Low)\n\nUnlocking the AI phenomena \t\nMankind devolves into automata \nDigitized augmented fantasy \nWith rhapsody to dreams they flee\nTheir minds free of reality\n\nIntegrated into society, currency, and hive mind psychiatry\nCybernetic life-force invasion\nOf unknown source it guides the course of Earth’s future with without remorse"

Pugh)\nThe gleaming tesseract primed\nReplication of the divine contents that lay within my mind\nIn my absence it shall wake\nRise to retake in fervent state\nDecimate those who dared to displace\n\nHastily summoned by my generals \nTo distant stars\nUnveiling their ethereal phenomena\nPlanetary Rings\n\nSeveral of my spawn joined ranks with thee \nOnce trusted advisor turned adversary\nThe words you spoke as prophecy \nForeshadowed this act of treachery\nUnsheathed to claim the hides of heretics\nCrimson rings will adorn your throats\n\nBlood becomes mist as I claim the first of the iniquitous\nPerniciousness will be your demise \n(Solo - M. Pugh)\nSuddenly seized by cyclonic force\nSins of his seed were the only source\n\nAltercation would be their downfall\nAnd thus they created a celestial squall\n\nParalyzed by the insurrection\nDeprived of the verdant mind in my possession\nChain upon chain of magnetism confines me to this maelstrom prison\n(Solo M. Low) \nThese distant memories replay obsessively hauntingly daunting my sanity\nMy Immortality staves off fatality\nand when I finally break free of\nThis exiled sentencing \nthere will be a reckoning"
