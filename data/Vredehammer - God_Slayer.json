  "description": "In 2024, Vredehammer, the mighty force from the deepest North returns. Vredehammer explore the depths of darkness and despair, painting a chilling sonic landscape that captures the essence of true black metal.\n\n\n\nVredehammers upcoming album “God Slayer” is poised to deliver nothing short of blackening excellence, Vredehammer continues to push the boundaries of extreme metal, seamlessly blending elements of blackened death metal, thrash, and melodic death metal to create a sound that is both relentless and captivating.\n\n\n\nWith one of Scandinavia's finest BM drummers, Nils 'Dominator' Fjellström, on drums, combined with the unparalleled musical songwriting and guitar skills of Per Valla, this album is not to be missed.\n\n\n\nVredehammer about the album: “With the Godslayer album I wanted to take a step back regarding tempo, not focusing so much on fast songs. There is definitely some fast stuff in there, but my main objective was to create memorable songs and guitar riffs with a lot of punch and power to them.\n\n\n\nThis time Vredehammer had the pleasure of having Nils “Dominator” Fjellström doing drums for the album. Having played with Nils on other occasions, I was excited to see how he would perform when the music didn’t just consist of fast black metal stuff, which is known to be his specialty. He definitely rose to the occasion and contributed with some great ideas for the drums.”",

Abyss ..Born\nAbyss.. Abyss ..Born"
