      "lyrics": "What hides beneath beauty\nAs elegant seams split and fray\nA smile that never reaches their eyes\nSweet scents that mask a rotten stench\nMagnificence cedes to squalor\nWhen gilded hearts melt to ash\n\nThe mercy of a gentle lie\nThe malice of a naked truth\n\nPracticed grace belies a cruelty\nAnd charm yields to enmity\nA lover's whisper carries a curse\nEven in the warming haze of spring\nBut the chill returns, and leaves fall\nAnd the cold clarity of winter leaves us bare\n\nThe mercy of a gentle lie\nThe malice of a naked truth\nNothing good can last\n\nNothing good can last\n\nShorn of our pretense\nStripped of the sun\nDawn was the promise\nThe dusk ripped away\n\nNothing good can last"
