  "description": "After 3 highly praised EPs it’s now finally time for a full length! Brutish and dark vibes outline the spectrum in which ENGULF moves its steps, with catchy riffs, gnarly vocals, savage Death Metal!\n\n\n\nNew Jersey's Engulf is Hal Microutsicos' (also in Blasphemous) Death Metal solo project. After 3 story-driven Eps released from 2017 to 2019 with the intention to draw out a genuine Death Metal approach and sound, spanning from the forefathers of the genre to much more modern approaches, Engulf is now ready to step up and unleash its massive and savage first full length debut album \"The Dying Planet Weeps\".\n\n\n\nFor fans of Hate Eternal, early Gorguts, early Decapitated and early Ulcerate.",
