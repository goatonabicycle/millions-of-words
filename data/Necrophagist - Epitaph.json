  "album_name": "Epitaph",
  "description": "Uniting head-spinning musicianship, elaborate arrangements and an acute sense of dynamics within composition, Necrophagist have reset the bar for complexity and technique in modern-day death metal. Their powerful riffs, mind-blowing sweeps and arpeggios, crushing percussion and intricately designed songs are unequalled and uncompromising, unveiling an invincible technicality so sharp and precise, it threatens to bore a hole directly through the heart of the existing progressive death playbook.",
