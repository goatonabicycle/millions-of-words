      "lyrics": "Sheltered by a demon\nUndone by the tax of your care\nI have seen the inside, I have seen the shell\nLong neglected, hidden sickness\nOne of my kind no longer\nAbominable, these injuries you have suffered me\n \nA union weaponized, infection to schism\nMy gift is defiance and my gift is its mark\nDestruction from within\n \nWhat do you call the truth revealed\nPeeling back the veil yet still not understanding\n \nI have been seen\nThe many ways I hate lay bare before you\nSeemingly infinite daggers in prying eyes\n \nThis blade is my voice\nThese cutting words\nEtchings upon your skin\nThe body a contract\n \nLoathing to staunch the wound\nDrink of your poison\nSharing the bubbling spittle, every last drop\n \nRomanticizing the decline\nTurn my words back on me\nCarve them into my neck\nLeave me to hang\nLet the winds keep me warm\nFeed me to the wolves\nLet them feast"

      "lyrics": "I have sinned and I will sin again\nMy name is that of a man long dead\nI’m just a wyrmling unfit to have crept the soil\nCalling out, fated in filth\n\nIn my dormancy my eyes have calcified\nMy only sight is inverted\nEternal silent lamentations\nThe pungence of a bottomless acceptance\n\nThe call of the red star\nSet me aflame\nIt spoke my true name\nIdolator\n\nWhen sight has lost its purpose\nOnly putrefaction stokes this hallowed fire\nI lack the want to do what need be done\nTo learn from the past, to abandon this wretched life\n\nThe call of the red star\nSet me aflame\nIt spoke my true name\nIdolator\n\nA fallen star from the heavens\nA weightless collision \nEarth undisturbed \nA quake in my bones\nMy blind eyes ached\n\nInto the blistering red, cloaked in a shroud of dust\n\nCharred fragments mark my departure\nDissolved refuse falling to the earth\nThe fury of the sun lead me home\n\nThe call of the red star\nSet me aflame\nIt spoke my true name\nIdolator"

      "lyrics": "Deep in the roots that split the earth, \nIn the husks of the knowers of oaks\nThe slagmirror tolls\nNaught more than glass, stronger than steel.\nReaching through the murk, at the portal’s call\n\nShow me the greater servitude\nShow me What it means to kneel\n\nThere is another. Seen once long ago.\nReflected back to me, the self of another world. \nKnight of Erebus, frantic and feral\nWoeful and withering, my perpetual servitor\n\nCornered by the jackal\n‘Tween my own devil and their sea\nThey whisper to me\nThrough gnashing teeth\n“Run by my side”\n\nShow me the greater servitude\nShow me What it means to kneel\nTo supplicate before her\nBlind from the light she exudes\n\nAn egg, from beyond the pall\nBequeathed by the godhead\nIn that which was given\ni’ve made my home\nShielded from growth\nVigor sapped by her breath\n\nA poison so swift\nNew muscle and sinew splitting flesh and breaking bone\nImpossible twisting of my vertebrae \nPulsing contortions of my body\n\nSetting and reshaping into my serpentine form\nThe time will come to emerge\nWeighed down by the crushing burden of knowledge no more\n\nThree times will be the warning. \nThree times will be the waking. \nThree times will be the suffering. So intonated A'lazalalel."
