  "description": "\"Impious\" deals with the question of the meaning of religion. The holy scriptures were put down to enable people to live together. In complete contrast to the charity that is imparted in almost all world religions, fanatics twist the scriptures in their favor and turn them into something violent and sick. The problem is not religion itself, but those who use it to claim their need of power in the name of god.",

Cleanse your hands, you sinners: and purify your hearts, you double minded“\n\nThy name echos in my mind\nMy feet stumble unholy ground\nI shall eat the weed on plain fields\nSelf-punishment will lead me through\n\nYour words were written by your servants\nThey’re not as holy as you can be\nWrong tongues and fingers misinterpreted\nSuicide can not be a sin\n\n“Do not be a fool. Why die before your time“\nWho are you to claim god's words?\n\nSo it is time to join my lord\nPrepared all night for this task\nI’ll burn myself till nothing's left\nThe fastest way to ascend\n\nA big cross does mark the place\nWhere I’ll carry out my sacrifice\nTo the cross I will now tie\nStanding right on the pyre\n\nA match will enlighten my last steps\nRight to the feet of you my lord\nI toss it down, I smell the smoke\nThe fire starts to light up\n\nI feel the heat on my bare feet\nThe pyre is starting to burn now\nThe heat gets more and more intense\nSweat is running down my face\n\nThe flames begin to devour me\nI lift my eyes right to the sky\nHere I come for you, my lord\nCome and see my sacrifice\n\nThe pain is getting unbearable\nI scream, I cry, I laugh, I smile\nA few more minutes for me to wait\nTill I can rise up to the sky"
