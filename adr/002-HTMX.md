# ADR 002: Use HTMX for Frontend Interactions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed a lightweight solution for dynamic frontend interactions without the complexity of a full JavaScript framework, while maintaining server-side rendering benefits.

## Decision
We chose HTMX because:
- Enables dynamic interactions without writing JavaScript
- Works well with server-side rendering
- Lightweight and simple to implement
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Good integration with Go's templating system
- Reduces client-side complexity

## Consequences
Positive:
- Simplified frontend development
- Reduced JavaScript bundle size
- Better SEO due to server-side rendering
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Easy integration with Go templates

Negative:
- Limited complex client-side interactions
- Less rich UI capabilities compared to full JavaScript frameworks
- May require more server-side processing
- Limited offline capabilities
