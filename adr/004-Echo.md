# ADR 004: Use Echo Web Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed a lightweight, high-performance web framework for Go that provides good routing, middleware support, and template rendering capabilities.

## Decision
We chose Echo because:
- High performance and low memory footprint
- Simple and intuitive API
- Built-in middleware support
- Good template rendering capabilities
- Active community and maintenance
- Good documentation
- Compatible with HTMX approach

## Consequences
Positive:
- Fast request handling
- Clean and maintainable code structure
- Good middleware ecosystem
- Easy integration with other Go libraries
- Good performance characteristics

Negative:
- Less feature-rich than some alternatives
- Smaller ecosystem compared to some other frameworks
- May require additional middleware for some features
- Learning curve for complex routing scenarios
