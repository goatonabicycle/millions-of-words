# ADR 000: Maintain Architecture Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to document the architectural decisions made in this project to maintain a clear record of why certain technologies and approaches were chosen.

## Decision
We will maintain Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in markdown format in the `/adr` directory. Each ADR will follow this format:

- Title: ADR-XXX: [Short title of the decision]
- Status: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
- Context: [The context and problem statement]
- Decision: [The decision that was made]
- Consequences: [The consequences of the decision, both positive and negative]

## Consequences
- Provides clear documentation of architectural decisions
- Makes it easier for new team members to understand the project's evolution
- Helps maintain consistency in future development
- Requires additional documentation effort
