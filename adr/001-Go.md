# ADR 001: Use Go as Primary Programming Language

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed a performant, statically-typed language that excels at handling concurrent operations and web services for our lyrics analysis application.

## Decision
We chose Go as our primary programming language because:
- Strong standard library with excellent HTTP support
- Built-in concurrency primitives (goroutines, channels)
- Fast compilation and execution
- Simple deployment with single binary output
- Strong typing and error handling
- Growing ecosystem of web frameworks and tools

## Consequences
Positive:
- High performance for text processing and analysis
- Easy deployment and distribution
- Good concurrency support for handling multiple requests
- Strong community support and documentation

Negative:
- Learning curve for developers new to Go
- Less mature web framework ecosystem compared to some alternatives
- Limited GUI development capabilities
