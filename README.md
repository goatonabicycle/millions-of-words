## What is this?

This is me learning Go and htmx. Ultimately, this will be a mechanism to explore the lyrics of albums in a couple of interesting ways.

## What's the thinking?
Using lyrics and info from Bandcamp, I should be able to start using it in interesting ways.

- Show the data
  - Have a way of counting and sorting word usage. 
  - Sentiment stuff.
  - I might be able to create some interesting visualisations based on word length
  - Each page could have a unique style based on the album cover?


- Turns out hosting this is a bit of a pain. I could go full serverless with a database.

## What do I need to run this? 
Just Go at the moment.

## How do I run this? 

`go run main.go`

## Deploy: 

Deploy: `flyctl deploy`
